        <summary>Preamble</summary>
        <div class="charter-section-body">
          <p>
            Let it be known across every sea, from the shallowest shoal to the deepest blue,
            that the Captains of this Clan do hereby bind themselves in fellowship.
            Not by force, nor by fear, but by <em>shared purpose</em>, <em>mutual respect</em>,
            and the timeless joy of ships under sail.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are not a navy of conscripts. We are a company of free captains — each choosing
            to stand beside the others as comrades, rivals, teachers, and friends.
          </p>
        </div>

      <!-- Article I -->

        <summary>Article I — The Spirit of the Fleet</summary>
        <div class="charter-section-body">
          <p>
            This Clan exists for one purpose above all:
          </p>
          <p class="charter-highlight">
            To enjoy the great game of Naval Action together.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether a captain commands a mighty first rate or a humble cutter, all are welcome
            at our table. Skill is not demanded. Experience is not required. Only good humour,
            fair conduct, and a willingness to sail with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are <strong>no expectations</strong> of attendance, performance, or contribution.
            A captain may sail daily or once a fortnight — all are valued equally.

      <!-- Article II -->
      <details class="charter-section">
        <summary>Article II — Conduct Becoming of a Captain</summary>
        <div class="charter-section-body">
          <p>Every member of this Clan shall:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Treat fellow captains with courtesy and respect</li>
            <li>Offer aid when able, and accept aid when needed</li>
            <li>Celebrate victories together</li>
            <li>Endure defeats together</li>
            <li>Remember that behind every ship is a person seeking enjoyment</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We are a fleet, not a factory. We measure success not in ports held, but in
            <em>good company and good battles</em>.

      <!-- Article III -->
      <details class="charter-section">
        <summary>Article III — Discord & Communication</summary>
        <div class="charter-section-body">
          <p>
            The Admiralty recognises that not all captains favour the same tools of communication.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>1. For general sailing, crafting, trading, and casual play:</strong><br>
            Discord is <strong>not required</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2. For PvP engagements, coordinated operations, and RvR actions:</strong><br>
            Discord <strong>is required</strong>, so that captains may hear orders, relay sightings,
            and act as one.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is not a burden, but a necessity — for in the smoke and thunder of battle,
            silence is defeat.

            We are a Clan that <strong>helps its own</strong>.

          <ul>
            <li>Share knowledge freely</li>
            <li>Assist new sailors in finding their sea legs</li>
            <li>Provide ships, cannons, or resources when able</li>
            <li>Escort traders, defend clan waters, and rally to distress calls</li>

          <p>No captain shall be left adrift.</p>

            As the winds shift and the seas change, so too may this Charter.
            Amendments may be proposed by any captain and ratified by consensus.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Charter is a living document — a compass, not a chain.
